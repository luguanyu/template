			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p> In conclusion, during this formal research, I explain the definition and application of the Computer Engineering. As well as the explanations, this research is also a kind of review for me on the Computer Engineering. The concept of Engineer, the specific professional areas, and the advantages, these are all the information I get from the research. It is no doubt that the Computer Engineering makes a lot contribution to the social development. It brings us a convenient and efficient lifestyle with once and once innovation. And for angle of view from the society, these products designed by computer engineers are also working with the social responsibility. The products pay more attention on the energy-saving and the environmental protection, and the increase of the technic companies also brings more job opportunities for the society. Overall, the Computer Engineering is what I focus and a great career no matter for individual or the public. </p>

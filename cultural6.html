			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p> When we focus more on the education and the institution, I believe we can find the original moral back and people have better life quality then the money is not the stuff stop our route to the dream and “American Dream” anymore. If the world is more tolerant, the respective and people can make alive by own self. Then this land can shine the “American Dream” again. When the material wealth problems go around us everyday, no one can take peaceful in the real life and no dream anymore, like Mr. White, he have to betray own belief and lie to the family just for the money and the feeling of success because he did not get successful in the life before. Like a student called Jellenik said: “(Breaking Bad) began during a time when the “American Dream” was failing for a lot of people, like Walter White,” So the social, not only individual but also media, companies and government, have responsibility to make effort for the moral, economy and education. Thus we can save the people fail their “American Dream”, left them the hope of life. </p>

			<p>I make an interview with my teacher, who teaches the computer. I ask him what is special for the Computer Engineering from the Computer science and Electrical Engineering. He told me the most specific feature of computer engineering is the general. The general here does not mean it is suitable for every career. The correct understand is that the computer engineering can cover both hardware and software designs; the general between the software and hardware can bring people a multiple ideas and thinking about the design. For example, nowadays, no matter the software or hardware design, they both have one question called “over property.” It means the some software or hardware designer focuses on own career within product design without thinking of practice, and then may cause the higher hardware property with lower software property or higher software property with lower hardware property. In this case, the computer engineers can be familiar with both sides so as to avoid the “over property” or “property waste.” However, there are also some disadvantages about the computer engineering, which is that due to computer engineering covers two sides, then the students sometimes do not study deep as the computer science and electrical engineering student do. Luckily, the elective courses offer the deep course for computer engineering students on hardware side or software side. It gives the choice to the students to choose which career they prefer more. </p>
			<p>Due to the common of the computer engineering I mentioned before, wherever we can see the track of computer engineering in daily life. When you use your smart phone to phone your friends and relatives, there is the track of computer engineering, when you pick up your phone and send an E-mail to others, there is the track of computer engineering, and even when you feel tired on the subway, and you play the apps on the cell phone, it is also the computer engineers can do. In the product design process, the computer engineer can balance the complication between the software applications and the hardware design due to they are familiar on both careers. This is also the advantages of computer engineer compared to the computer science and electrical engineering. Thus, the computer engineer is more like an assistant role in the product design process, and finds the solution for complications between software and hardware design. After the first and second Industrial Revolution, the efficiency of the industries grew as quick as it can. The electric get practiced in more area after the second Industrial Revolution also bright the scientists the ways to create and innovate. Tracking the development of the technology, the ways that we find and make the innovations are always by find the new area and combine the old technology then improve it. It seems like what the computer engineers can do. It is combined discipline, and it place in a new and innovative career. These elements can bring computer engineering professional career active and more passion for the development of technology. For this reason, I stand the side that the Computer Engineering can bring more surprise to the technology career. </p>
			<p>I made an interview with my uncle, who worked in a technology company as a computer engineer. He told me that due to the computer engineering major students knows the electrical design and code writing, they can join the early design of the product design, and they also can do the product test for the product. If the product gets trouble in the test about the bad compatibility, the advantage of the computer engineering can appear, they can solve the problems more quickly and efficiently. </p>

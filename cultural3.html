			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>  In 2013, there was a TV show called “Breaking Bad” actives tens of thousands’ interest and passion. It talks about a story of a smart chemist cooks the drug and sells them. In my opinion, the point why this TV show so attractive is it acts how a people get changed from a nice but not successful enough one to a bad guy. It is similar with most people, which mean that we are normal, sometimes a little unsuccessful and get annoyed from environment around us, but the Mr. White, the character in this TV show, made changes and do what he want. After he knew he got cancer, he wanted to use own chemical knowledge to cook meth for leaving amount of money to his family. However, it is “cooking drug”, and it is crime. In this TV show, White got shamed by his students when he did par-time job in car wash store, and the employer add working time and difficulties for him. This cause White angry and quite job. The less tolerant lead him to angry and with the cancer coming, he decided to do what he want and make exciting life, though the reason he thought was for leaving money for family. Though he doubted if he cooked meth is right and linger a lot. But The final clue which leads White cook the mess is the trust between White and the drug dealer Crazy-8, because he found Crazy-8 want to kill him and betray his trust, and he had to kill him. Without the trust, Mr. White dropped down the way to the darkness. White used to be a potential chemist, but he give up a successful way due to some reasons and he fails his “American Dream”. The pressure and the life’s unpleasure made him heartbreak, and he decided to crime. On the other hand, “American Dream” and the pressure of “American Dream” push White to the darkness. The pressure of “American Dream” , the life pressure, leads White to the way of crime and the “American Dream”, freedom and achieve own goals, induce White to the darkness. The negative side of “American Dream” becomes the guide of White to the meth cooker. White is just a character, but in real life, there may be more people like White being mislead to the negative side of “American Dream.”</p>

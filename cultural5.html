			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>  The way to correct the “American Dream” is the institution and education. At first, we can not ignore the economy or wealth plays important role in “American Dream” and our daily life. The great institution will increase the economy, and if everyone has a great life, they have more confidents and passion to pursue the mental wealth. In the “Breaking Bad,” when Mr. White waked up after faint down, he found he was at ambulance, then he ask the doctor let him out because he does not good insurance to pay the fee of emergency. This moment makes people heartbreak, and at that time, what I saw was a man want to save money as he can for family. If the institution is better, then the public will have better chance to gain the life they want with a legal way. For example, focusing on the manufacturing industry and then we can offer more job opportunity for the public and also support more on the small companies for their growing, and these companies can create more jobs and creativity for the country. The education is also an important to solve the negative side of “American Dream,” and if we educate the young and children pursue dream by own effort bravely and teach them positive attitude to the world and value, the young can instead money of their own dream as the goal. How money influences people’ choice? I remember there was one time I arrived an engineering connect session about one major called material engineering. I am not this major student but interesting in material engineering. After the professor played the PPT of introduction of material engineering, he ask students what part of material engineering attract you, then most students said salary. It does not mean they do not like that major but at least the interest of money is more than the interest of the major own self. If everyone only considers the money, they may lose the creative or they may go to the darkness for money, like Mr. White. Then the respect and tolerance are also one part of education people should make effort. In the “Breaking Bad”, when Mr. White do the part-time job in the car wash store, he met his students, and the students laughed and shamed on him. This also causes the White fall down to the darkness indirectly. The “American Dream” indicates the freedom, which is the respective, equality freedom and not the rude and random. It is kind of the loss of moral. Thus, no matter the education or the better institution, they all can save the people who fail the “American Dream” and save the “American Dream” own self. </p>

			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>In this research, I choose two sources to clarify the application of the computer engineering in the technology. One source is “Computer Engineering; Reports Summarize Computer Engineering Research from Technical University” from the Energy Weekly News. It is a trade journals article. In this article, it mentioned a new area research of Computer Engineering, the sensor network. It is a research about the compare between the multi mobile sensor and the stationary sensors. “The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Technical University, ‘We investigate how the sensor network performs in the case when the sensor nodes move. We compare the simulation results for two cases: the sensor network with stationary sensor nodes and multi mobile sensor nodes. The simulation results have shown that for the multi mobile sensors, the goodput is unstable. Also, the goodput of stationary sensors is better than multi mobile sensors. In case of consumed energy, the consumed energy of multi mobile sensors is better than stationary sensor.’” (“Computer Engineering; Reports Summarize Computer Engineering Research from Technical University.” Energy Weekly News. 4 Jan 2013) The research also do the experiment about the factors cause the different. In this research, the researchers look for the advance of the different sensor in different situation, Energy-saving and goodput, and the research is helpful to figure out the solution in different cases. This is what Computer Engineer does in the professional career. They did this research so as to work for the potential problem in the future, with time go on. For example, the Energy-saving sensor can work in the equipment of factory which needs the sensor do a lot work, and it can save the energy and decrease cost then improve the profits of economy. For the private equipment, the energy saving sensor can save the battery and increase the usage time of smartphones. Also, in the future, the goodput sensors will play a significant character in the electrical equipment, especially the communication equipment. It works on the GPS locate accurately, the signal stable, robot design. Thus, the goodput sensors also have specific use in specific cases. The sensors are one specific example of how the computer engineer focuses on the hardware area application. </p>
			<p>The second source I use is a scholarly journals article, “Satisficing Games and Decision Making: With Applications to Engineering and Computer Science” written by the Andrew, Alex M. This article discussed about the theme of how to project the game and decision making during the game design. During the article, we know that “In the theory of games and economic behaviour as developed notably by von Neumann and Morgenstern, it is assumed that players act purely in self-interest and that for each there is a pay-off to be maximised. With more than two players there are complications that have led to the introduction of principles such as Pareto optimality and Nash equilibrium. A shortcoming of these is that they may indicate a solution (or a set of solutions) that is in some sense optimal, but not how it might have been reached by the interacting players. Also, there are situations that do not lend themselves to such analysis, one such arising when the preferences of one player depend on a choice made by another. A final and crucial shortcoming is that for many situations the results of the analysis do not correspond well with the observed behaviour of actual players.”(Andrew, Alex M. “Satisficing Games and Decision Making: With Applications to Engineering and Computer Science.” Kybernetes. 2005), which includes an engineer’s thinking about the balance between the profits and the user experience. No matter the software or the game, they both work for the customers, so the theory of the engineer is the server for the customers, and the user experiences becomes the core value in the design project. For example, the Apple just use only three years to pull the cell phone tycoon, Nokia, done from the seat, and how does Apple do it？In my opinion, the most convinced reasons are the better user experience from the remarkably innovation. The Iphone use complete touch sensor screen make the operation more convenient, but more excellent idea is that they designed a new system and induce a clear concept, the smart phone. Before the Iphone, most cellphones are not smart, which means the functions were limited as the phone call, message and basic entertainment. Those phones do not have the concept of the APP (application). Thus, after you bought the phones, there are not any other more interesting functions for you to enjoy. The IOS (Iphone’s system) offered the concept of APP, and allowed the customers download APP from Apple stores, which makes the phone more interesting because you can download different APP for multiple uses and have more fun. This is a specific concept of the engineer design theory on the successful design about the product for the customers. </p>
			<p>During the research, we know the computer engineers are not only finding the solutions and excellent design for the potential problems, but also have own discipline on the design with logical analysis with customers’ requirement. </p>

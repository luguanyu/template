	<p>Academic writing skill is a common skill in different careers and academies. A professional writing skill can benefit for applying the college, writing the resume, and reporting work. In this semester, I choose “WRA110: Science and Technology” as my writing class. This class does not only teach student how to write a great paper, but also teaches students some other technologic skills, such as website design. It requires students to finish four assignments, one final report, and fifteen entries blogs on github website and also require finish study of code academy about web design at the same time. The four assignments have different purpose for students understand writing skill and their major more deeply. Overall, the knowledge what I learn from this class enhances my writing skills and practice my some technologic skills.</p>
        <p>The first assignment was Lived Experience Project. It required students to talk about the technology, which lead students to choose their major, and own experience related to the major. The students also needed to describe the professional career track in the future about their major. When I started doing this assignment, I did not know how to start this assignment, and I thought I just need to write down what I know about my major. However, the professor set a homework, which asks for answer several question and write down as the draft. The questions asked such as “what is the purpose of my project? Describe one piece of technology and its impact of my academic /career path, etc.” This homework helped a lot for this assignment. After did that draft, I found out some clear ideas to write. I talked about that how IPhone changed my life and why I decided to choose the computer as my future career when I was just a high school students. And I also discussed about the differences between Computer Engineering and Computer Science for explaining about my major choice. In this assignment, I think I describe clearly about the technology induces me to study the major now and also have a more clear understand of the major. Overall, the first assignment is not hard to write but need students have a deep understand about what they learn in college and the major. If I could rewrite this assignment, I would pay more attention on the general organization of the essay and check the grammar correctly. This assignment left a general impression about the main concept of this writing class and was helpful for students to start the next several assignments.</p>
        <p>The second assignment talked about the cultural analysis. It required students to talk about one of the cultures, and analyzed this culture critically. The students need to discuss the issue related to the chosen culture and came up the solution to the issue. This topic was very interesting because you can discuss any cultures you like. The most important points to this essay are particular description of the issue of culture and the specific analysis with solution. As an international student, the easiest way for me to know American culture was the American TV show. Thus, in this assignment, I discussed about the famous TV show “Breaking Bad” as the model to analysis. The main idea about this assignment was talk about how to balance the material wealth and the metal moral. The more deep point was to discuss about how “American Dream” fall down from what we can see from Mr. White. After draft wrote down, the team review each other paper on D2L and some classmates pointed out the topic was too huge to clarify the cultural analysis part. Then I started to refine the paper by select some epitome scene about “Breaking Bad.” It was a kind of metaphor about how a person changed from good guy to bad man, under the stress called “American Dream.” I wished to analysis the “Breaking Bad” to clarify what is the negative side of “American Dream” and how we avoid it then maximize the positive part of “American Dream.” Reviewing this project, I do not think I did the best job on this paper, but I improved a lot on the writing skill by this experience in the analysis of the resource and the construction of the essay. I started to read the book for finding resource such as what is the definition of “American Dream.” What do people think about “American Dream?” I started to search some deep things of a topic and learn how to find and use the resource to refine my paper. I think the purpose of this project is not only to write a kind of culture but more important is to start learning how to analyze the issue and get own judge on the culture.</p>
        <p>The third assignment was the hardest and longest paper in this semester. It was a formal research project. The students need to find the resource for a specific academic discipline. They need to analysis at least one scholarly and one trade public article found as the resource, and do some interview and analysis about the chosen academic discipline. The whole paper required at least 2700 words. I discussed my major in this paper. I found out several published articles related to my major online and read them. The most difficult thing was we had to write the bibliography, and the due time was hurry at the same day I started to research. I had to read those resources clearly. It was a hard job to do for me. Due to I am an international student, and the English is not my first language, I sometimes got trouble on reading so long article to find out the information I needed. However, the more effort, the more harvest. I spent a long time to read the resource I found and refine the information I needed to use. Unfortunately, though I finished the bibliography, I missed the due day of the draft of this project and I did not finish the draft for this project. This mistake made the foreshadowing for this unsuccessful experience of writing. Then I started to write the project. I had to say this 2700 words paper was the experience I never ever want to experience again because I felt so failure on it. To be honestly, I did not work seriously on this project. I just tried to write the words and I cited a lot of content of the resources. After I submitted the paper, I realized I did not try hard than before. The main reason was I did not write the draft for a clear idea about the project, and I told myself I would not make this mistake again, anyway. This experience teaches me to remember writing the draft before the final paper and encourages me to keep serious to every project. If I could rewrite this assignment again, I would refine the resource better and cite the resource brief but clearly. And another main point to do a good job about this project is the specific analysis about the discipline and resource. In the academic writing, the analysis always plays an important role.</p>
        <p>  The forth project was the most interesting one project I ever wrote before. It called “multimedia remix project” and required students make teams to do a video talk about one essay they wrote before. Then students need to write the memo of the project. Because all of my team members like to play video games and one member wrote an essay about the games, we decided to discuss about how games affect our life. We first decided to make a documentary to discuss if video games were advantages or disadvantages and used different people’s life experience about the games by interviewing. I was the interviewer and other two members were photographer and interviewee. We first made some question for interview and find some resources for the citation in the video. Honestly, I felt nervous to interview people but also interesting. I interviewed different people with same question for making comparison. After interviewing people, we cut the videos and composed different videos together by the application called IMovie. The most important part for me during this project was making the subtitle for the video. Sometimes it was hard to listen every word clearly in the interview. Then, every student wrote the memo about the video individual. The memo seemed like a review for the experience and the conclusion for this assignment. Student needed to think and analyze the video and assignment deeply with specific details. This is a unique experience to make the video. No matter the refinement of the video or the collection for resource for the video, it allowed me to have a more interesting skill. This assignment embodies the multiple elements in this class and embodies the technology clearly.</p>
        <p>Another feature of this class is the code academy and github website. The class required students to study code academy and submit the paper to the github website. These were new concepts for me study. At initial several weeks, I always got trouble to the github set, so I had to ask the professor a lot for the reason of the unused of the github. The professor explained to me nicely and patiently. I finished the github work well with the professor’s help. The code academy taught how to make the html website. It is helpful to know how to set the github website efficiently. These two concepts let me learn more knowledge on this class.</p>
        <p>The four unique articles taught me how to write a good essay by researching the resource, making the preparation well and the important of the draft. With the study of the code academy, I did not only learn how to write but how to design the website as the technology. This class improved my skill and brought me the knowledge I would use for a long time in the future academic and career life.</p>
        <p> Finally, I want to give some suggestion to the incoming students about how to get success in this class. First, finishing the draft of the assignment and the peer review on the d2l are very important. The students must do it because when you finish the draft, you have a rough idea about how to construct the article. The reason to finish the peer review is that after the students can read other classmates’ draft, they can get suggestions from other classmates and get some idea from reading other’s draft, so it is helpful a lot when you write the formal articles. Second suggestion is that the students should arrange the schedule well. There are four assignments and one final assignment through on semester, so, basically, there are enough time to finish the assignment perfectly. But if the students do not arrange the schedule well, they would feel hurry to finish the paper, and this would influence the grades. Third suggestion is that if you have any question, feel free to ask professor. In this class, the professor’s explanation helps a lot for students on the homework and paper writing, so do not feel shy to ask the question, and the professor is glad to answer the question for you.

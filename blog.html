                        <p>This week I write the draft of the “Live experience project”. It is a project that talks about the specific technology which influence a lot. I wrote the IPhone4. It is an interesting project and lead me think a lot of things long ago, such as why I chose this major, who induced me to the electrical product area, and when I started playing computer engineering? It was like a memory recall. I submit the draft to the D2L group, and a lot of classmate review it. They also give some feedback about my draft. Different people have different opinion, but honestly, their suggestions are awesome and so useful. Sometimes when you write essays, you can not find some disadvantages, so the advices from other people are crucial for the author. I think it is awesome idea to let students talk about the draft and leave suggestions. It benefits everyone in the class. I think this class is very interesting because it has some multiple cultures. We don’t only write paper but also watch videos for learning different kind of knowledge and learn writing skills from those videos. 
In my opinion, the writing skill is one of the most important skills in the academic life. In the future 4 years university study life, we need write a lot of article in different class. Thus I hope I can do a good job on this class and learn writing skill for the future academic life. I believe hard working earns better results.

                        <h4>Identifies the group of people targeted in the video</h4><p>The group of people targeted in the video is the fans of computer games or video games. They spend a lot of time on playing the games and ignore the normal socialization in real world, and they may think the socialization in the game is the same with the real life socialization.</p>
                        <h4>Explains the social issue at hand</h4><p>The social issue in the video talks about how the “World Of Warcraft” changes these players’ life. In the reality life, there are more and more people spend a lot of money and time on the games. They ignore physical practice, the social network, and the studying knowledge. The original principle of game is a way for people to have entertainment during the boring time, but nowadays the principle has been changed and destroyed a lot. </p>
                        <h4>Identifies and critiques the video's creators' view on that social issue</h4><p>The video may want people pay more attention on the normal socialization and decrease the time on the game. The video’s creator may also expect the game companies do some efforts on making people life with normal socialization, or decreasing the bad influences on the player, and pay more attention on their healthy. There are more things important than games such as family, friends and health. The game company also should take responsibility to the more and more negative influence of the games. This video is a kind of caution to the public how the games influence our life, and we need to do some efforts for changing the negative situation of  the games.</p>

                        <p>  The advertisement is about the Chrysler car. In the advertisement, it use the imagery of Detroit. This is a great strategy. From the imagery of Detroit, we can see the remarkable building of Detroit and the sculptures. These imageries make people feel powerful and great property of cars. All these imageries can bring people relate the feeling from the imageries to the cars. Then the imageries let people think this car is powerful, good property, high speed, and exciting. These bring people passion from the imageries. </p>
                        <p>  The advertisement uses the Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself.” It is a great idea. Firstly, the Eminem comes from Detroit, and the car was imported from Detroit, too. Thus, Eminem in the advertisement represents the Detroit city. The song “Lose Yourself” can represent the situation of Detroit clearly. Due to the depression, the city Detroit loses itself. It is a kind of representative of the Detroit. But it also means a kind of hope and wish to wake up after lose the Detroit itself. The song is not only make the sense of Detroit but also bring the kind of hope to the city. </p>

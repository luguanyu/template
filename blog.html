                        <p>This week I write the draft of the “Live experience project”. It is a project that talks about the specific technology which influence a lot. I wrote the IPhone4. It is an interesting project and lead me think a lot of things long ago, such as why I chose this major, who induced me to the electrical product area, and when I started playing computer engineering? It was like a memory recall. I submit the draft to the D2L group, and a lot of classmate review it. They also give some feedback about my draft. Different people have different opinion, but honestly, their suggestions are awesome and so useful. Sometimes when you write essays, you can not find some disadvantages, so the advices from other people are crucial for the author. I think it is awesome idea to let students talk about the draft and leave suggestions. It benefits everyone in the class. I think this class is very interesting because it has some multiple cultures. We don’t only write paper but also watch videos for learning different kind of knowledge and learn writing skills from those videos. 
In my opinion, the writing skill is one of the most important skills in the academic life. In the future 4 years university study life, we need write a lot of article in different class. Thus I hope I can do a good job on this class and learn writing skill for the future academic life. I believe hard working earns better results.

                        <p>This week I revise my “Lived experience project.” I took the advices from classmates for adding more details. I feel so easy when I finish the paper. I do not know how this one looks like but I tried to make the change I can. It is so lucky to get advices from classmates and also I get improved from this paper and writing experience. Next week we will have a new project and I need to write the draft for it. From this “Lived Experience project,” I feel it is a good way to improve my writing skills. I also comprehend my major better. The class also requires to study the code academy and put article on the github website. These are new things for me. As my major is Computer Engineering , I absolutely like to start HTM studying on the code academy. These things make the class cooler and more attractive to me. </p>

                        <h4>Identifies the group of people targeted in the video</h4><p>The group of people targeted in the video is the fans of computer games or video games. They spend a lot of time on playing the games and ignore the normal socialization in real world, and they may think the socialization in the game is the same with the real life socialization.</p>
                        <h4>Explains the social issue at hand</h4><p>The social issue in the video talks about how the “World Of Warcraft” changes these players’ life. In the reality life, there are more and more people spend a lot of money and time on the games. They ignore physical practice, the social network, and the studying knowledge. The original principle of game is a way for people to have entertainment during the boring time, but nowadays the principle has been changed and destroyed a lot. </p>
                        <h4>Identifies and critiques the video's creators' view on that social issue</h4><p>The video may want people pay more attention on the normal socialization and decrease the time on the game. The video’s creator may also expect the game companies do some efforts on making people life with normal socialization, or decreasing the bad influences on the player, and pay more attention on their healthy. There are more things important than games such as family, friends and health. The game company also should take responsibility to the more and more negative influence of the games. This video is a kind of caution to the public how the games influence our life, and we need to do some efforts for changing the negative situation of  the games.</p>

                        <P>The “Cultural analysis project required students to analyze the culture. In this week I just wrote the draft and got the feedback. I hovered a lot about what to write on the culture. As an international student, I want to discuss about the “American Dream,” because I think the “American dream” is an attractive concept to the international student, also include me. I want to write a critical article about the “American Dream,” such as what is the definition, how does it come from, is there an disadvantages? Then I remembered one TV show, which was famous recently called “Breaking Bad”. It talks about a man, who has cancer, makes the meth and sells it for money. He changes from a teacher to a meth cooker. All the reasons of these changes are due to the pursuing of the money. Since the world develops so fast, more and more people spend more time and effort on pursuing the money and ignore the moral. Thus, in this project, I discussed the “Breaking Bad” as an example to discuss how do we face the development of the negative side of “American Dream.” After I submit the draft, classmates thought it was good idea to discuss this fashion TV show, but I lacked the details of the description and some critical thinking. Thus, comparing the draft, I added more own thinking and more details on it. I understand that the analysis is always important and straight way to embody your own thinking and ideas in a successful essay. </P>

                        <p>This week I did the codeacademy study. It is very interesting. Maybe most people would not use the html everyday, but it would be beneficial if you learn more things. I always believe people should not restrict self in only one career or area. The different experience would be better for personal value and own development. As I come to America, it is a kind interesting and wonderful experience in my life. I live in a totally different culture, and everything for me is new, such as, language, culture, and eating. I travel to Chicago, I experience the American Thanksgiving day, and I study knowledge in different culture. I know my language are not good enough and still can not understand the American culture at all, but I appear the courage, a kind of courage that study in totally different area, totally different culture and totally strange environment. I think the courage is the best way to defend the fear. Thus, this experience is valuable in my life and my own culture.

                        <p>This week we need to do the formal research project. I need to read some articles. It is so boring job. I just find some resource about my major. This course is interesting but honestly, this project is a boring one and very hard one. I check the requirement, and it said the essay should be at least 2700 words. Unbelievable, this is the longest paper I ever write. I need to do it and summary them due to it is one of the homework. I also need cite the resource from the article so I need to review how to do citation in the correct format. When I finish the draft, I know this project is not easy one because even when I write the draft, I still do not have some clear idea. The good thing about this essay is the resource I found talks about my major a lot. I learn something from it, such as the development direction of my major, how is it salary, etc. This project does not have group discussion so I can not get suggestion from classmate. I still need to practice my reading skill after I finish the article reading. I think this week I need to work hard on the formal research project. Luckily, the professor helped me a lot, she taught me how to find the resource and general area about the resource I need to find. From this help, I can narrow down the research area and get the article clearly. </p>
                        <h1>blog NO.8</h1>
                        <p>This week I start to write the final formal research project. I summarized the article resource I found and did some refine about it. When I wrote it, I thought it is like the “Lived Experience project” I wrote before because it also talked the major and the story about the major. However, on another hand, it is not totally same with the first project because it required doing the research and more professional knowledge about the major. Thus I need to do more in the analysis and more professional information to this project. As the name of this project “formal research project”, the essay need to include more and more research information and the professional words. It is a kind of challenge to me. I tried my best on the combination between my story with the major and professional information I refined from the resource. I wish my essay can get a good grades.</p>

                        <p>  The advertisement is about the Chrysler car. In the advertisement, it use the imagery of Detroit. This is a great strategy. From the imagery of Detroit, we can see the remarkable building of Detroit and the sculptures. These imageries make people feel powerful and great property of cars. All these imageries can bring people relate the feeling from the imageries to the cars. Then the imageries let people think this car is powerful, good property, high speed, and exciting. These bring people passion from the imageries. </p>
                        <p>  The advertisement uses the Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself.” It is a great idea. Firstly, the Eminem comes from Detroit, and the car was imported from Detroit, too. Thus, Eminem in the advertisement represents the Detroit city. The song “Lose Yourself” can represent the situation of Detroit clearly. Due to the depression, the city Detroit loses itself. It is a kind of representative of the Detroit. But it also means a kind of hope and wish to wake up after lose the Detroit itself. The song is not only make the sense of Detroit but also bring the kind of hope to the city. </p>
                        <p>  The Tagline “Imported from Detroit” clarify where the car comes from. The Tagline “Imported from Detroit” also means the quality of the car. Everyone knows the Detroit makes cars and quality is pretty good. It can bring people confident to buy the cars, and it also bring the hope to the Detroit. It represent the pride of their city, “imported from Detroit.”</p>

                        <p>We start the “remix proposal project,” and it seems like the most interesting one in this semester. We need to shoot a video as documentary by group and write memo about the video individual. I meet with my group members and discuss what topic to shoot. We all like playing video games and we decided to shoot a video for talking about the benefits and disadvantages of video games. What we want is to discuss the advantage and disadvantage of video games by doing the interview. We can ask different people with the same question and compare the answer for getting the answer. I think the different answer from different people can be helpful to get fair conclusion about the judge of the games. We made an appointment with interviewees and design the question with process. I just want make everything works well and make sure the schedule is ok to everyone in the group. I will be the interviewer in the documentary, and the shooting starts at next week. I feel a little exciting about this project because it is interesting to shoot a video, and I can learn how to make change after the scene has been shot. It is another kind of learning. I think maybe I should watch some documentary for the start of this project. After the “formal research project,” I see this project as a rest and the technological skill improvement on this class. This semester will end in several weeks, and everyone start reviewing for course, so this project is a great way to balance the pressure of studying with the relax.</p>

                        <p>We finish the shooting of the video. I felt nervous at first moment when I interview people, but I suit the character quickly and interview better and better. The initial video looks good but I need to decorate it for adding some subtitle and some other parts of videos. The subtitle is hardest one because I have to listen what people say and type it corresponding with the video. Another difficult is the design of the process of different parts of videos. Every video represent one attitude and one kind of people, thus I need to put the videos in order for achieving the purpose of the video. However, different people has different comprehensive to stuffs. We discussed a lot for citing which video and how to put the video in correct order. Finally we find a common way for solving this problem. We change the videos, which cited in the documentary and find some new videos for citing in the documentary. The new cited videos connected different parts of video well.</p>

                        <p>This week is great because I finish the documentary. The subtitle is a hard one part but our team solves it together. Then the last thing is writing the memo. It is just a list of question about the video shooting. With this project experience, I learnt how to find the shoot angle and the great background-scene of documentary. Before this project, I die not know how to use the IMovie, and this project lead me to study how to use this software to make the videos. It represents the technology culture in this class by this project. After finishing this “Remix proposal project,” this semester is almost finished. There is only one final project left for us. I learn a lot in this class, no matter the writing skills and the technologic skills. The multiple culture of this class is attractive to me. I am so glad to choose this class as my academic writing class.</p>

                        <p>Today I finished the study of code academy. I felt exhausted about it. I am a Computer Engineering student and I like studying everything about the computer and the programmer, but I have to say that the codeacademy is a little low efficient. The codeacademy always required you do something you had done before. That is annoyed to me. I feel good on studying the computer stuffs but not repeat things again and again. Except that, the codeacademy is a perfect website to learn how to code. It will explain every detail and process clearly. I think it is one of the best websites for new to study code and other computer knowledge. I spend almost two week to finish the codeacademy. I learn how to design the basic sketch of the website and then how to decorate the website. For me, it teaches my academic major knowledge. For some other students who do not study computer, it interests their life I think. I feel so good on finishing codeacademy. </p>

                        <p>Today I just write my final paper. As the last assignment of this class in this semester, it required students to review this class and think about what they learn from this class. I think it is a good assignment. After almost four months study about the writing, we should review this semester and remind what we learn and what we earn from it. When I start this semester, I do not know the code academy and do not know how to code html. I also lack writing skills to finish a perfect essay and decorate the essay. With time go on, I feel my progress clearly, my writing logic grow mature, compared to the initial of this semester. This class is designed logically and smartly. Every assignment has own purpose. For example, may be one assignment focuses on the academy, while another one refers more on the technology. Multiple purposes of multiple kinds of the paper improve my skills eventually. This class will benefit my academic career in future a lot. </p>

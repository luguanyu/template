		<h1>Technology creates a dream of future</h1>

		<p>With the development of the society, the technology plays a more significant role in daily life. No matter computer or cell phone, they gradually have been a part of my life, and we can not live and work without them. For example, during my university life, I need to use the computer or cell phone to finish my homework online, I need to use the computer or cell phone to search the material, and even I need to use the computer for typing this assignment now. This is just a small example of the importance in our life. Thus, the electrical technology influences my life a lot, especially the computer technology, and I eventually decided to become a professional people in this interesting technical world, so I choose the computer engineering as my major and my future career. The smart and technical electrical products bring me to the computer engineering major.</p>
		<p>IPhone4 leads me to touching the career of smart technology. As a milestones smart phone during the development of the cell phone, IPhone4 open a new revolution to the public about the electrical product, even before IPone4 there were some awesome Apple’s smart phone. For me, actually, IPhone4 bring me to a new world called engineering. I still remembered that is 2010, and I start my high school as a freshman. Almost for everyone in the summer of 2010, the topic is only one exist, IPhone4. The first time I met IPhone4 was I took picture with my friend. I have to admit at that time, 2010, that the quality of IPhone4 camera was awesome, and the IPhone4 contained a best hand feeling at that time within all the cell phones. The IOS system exactly explains what is the smart phone and redefines this term again. For example, before the I Phone4, I always use the NOKIA phone with Symbian system, which is a keyboard, slow system phone and inconvenient enough, a kind of old fashion. The I Phone4 changes my view of phone. When I used it, the fingers touch the scream and move fast. The main use of I Phone4 for me was that I can watch the movie with the better scream, and the first movie I watched on my I Phone is “Kung Fu Panda.” The heavy panda moved so vividly showed on the I Phone4. Then, I knew a concept called APP, and I download it at Apple store. The first App I download is a game called “Angry Bird”, a world-fashion game at that time. I do not feel shame to say I spend a lot of time on that game at that time, due to it is so classic and interesting. The story between I and the smart phone start at I Phone. It is a door open to me to feel interesting of the Computer Engineering. That was the first time I knew smart phone can do like that, the first time I knew the system of cell phone, the first time I knew the 640*960 screen resolution, and the first time I know 3G connection. In my opinion, IPhone4 created a kind of people in China we call them “Apple Crazy Fans” which means the people who only purchase the Apple products as only one choice and purchase the newest one even stand in line for waiting the new product without logos. It also let people know 3G website better and actually improved the development of 3G website. But these effects are none of my business, for me the most important and deeply effect is this evolutional product activates my interesting, my passion, and my dream to learn, to live and to work in this amazing career.</p>
		<p>The experience about the engineering and the friends met in high school let me know these technologies more professional and love it deeply. When I studied in high school, I met a classmate who is very good at the computer technology, no matter system code or the hardware. We have a good friendship, and sometimes we would talk even discuss some technology. It is an interesting experience because when you discuss these ideas, you would get improvement in the wide of view and the better understand of technology. Then, we started to study some basic code design of the system language. It was a kind of boring work to do I have to say. We had to write the code everyday and make sure the no mistakes around the project. So, due to this reason, I gave up the idea of being a code writer, and my friend still focus on the system language writing. At that time, I face the confusion about what is suit to me and should I always follow my friend style? Luckily, when you fail for something, it is not always a bad news, because you can pass one thing more you do not want to do. It is important for people to find what they really like, or follow your heart. I began to think about what I like and what I want. Though I do not like the code writing, there is always one thing I totally sure is I want to become an engineering. So at least, I am sure the hardware design is what I like. The point of this experience is I find what I want and what I want to be. I collected the data of hardware design, compared them with the differences, and learnt the theory of the design. It is an interesting thing for me to do. The hardware is different with the software, which means it is stuff people can touch and design, a kind of basic stage for every product, while the software for me is like the boring system code without vivid. I go to some exhibition about the mechanical and electrical products to see and learn something. Even sometimes I am not professional enough but I actually have the passion to see it, to study it. The knowledge of hardware also brought me some interesting in life. Most friends would ask me for suggestion when they need to purchase new computer or new cell phone. These experiences also bring me confidents and happiness when I help them. The experience is value for me, and causes me love my major deeply.</p>
		<p>Computer Engineering is my favorite one around the Engineering. Before I apply the Michigan State University, I hesitate a lot about the major of the future. But a young age experience gives me answer. I remember one time I go to a house dealer to see a house, and there is nothing special in house but a technology seems like a smart house attract me. It is a smart design which house is more “humanity”. For example, it can change the air condition automatically for suiting body temperature, can boil water before master come back if master send the request online, etc. This design engraved in my heart and I want to design some thing like that, make the life more convenient and useful. That is what I will focus on. I search this technology and I figure out this is a big system need different career knowledge but the most important part is the electrical design and code writing. So I decided to choose the computer engineering, which satisfies both requirement of a complete design of a mature project. Computer Engineering is a kind of mix major of Electrical engineering and Computer science, hardware design and software design. Even I do not like the software system writing code, but I eventually realize it is a kind of skill for a successful Engineer. So when the hardware and software mix together, may some interesting thing happen just like a chemistry reactions. With this uncertain reason and the passion of becoming a mature and success engineer. </p>
		<p>The experience of high school, life detail and continual new technics gives me confident, love and passion to choose my major as a computer engineer. With the development of society, these technics becomes smarter. Only four years passed from IPhone4, the CPU in the cell phone did not only change in the frequency, from 1G hz to 1.8G hz even 2.5G hz, but also the number of the CPU, from only one CPU to dual CPU even 8 CPU in a cell phone. Thus with this fast improvement of these products, I totally believe the smart technical world will have a bright future, and the computer engineer will have more chances to become more successful.</p>

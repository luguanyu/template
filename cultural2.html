			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>As an international student, after I came to America, everything was so attractive. No matter the new culture or different language, they were new experience for me. The United States, a country composed by different people around the world, and the marks of this country is freedom, creative, hard-working and multiple cultural social. However, in my heart, the most attractive thing is not things above, but a value called “American Dream”. The definition of “American Dream” is "that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position."(James Truslow Addams, “The Epic of America”, 1931) In briefly, the elements just talks above, freedom, belief and hard working, are all involved in the “American Dream”, and for me the “American dream” means if you keep your effort, you will achieve your goals in life. With the survey, “Three quarters of Baby Boomers say a financial safety net is crucial to achieving the American Dream, but nearly as many say they don’t have a safety net in place. While 57% say they’re living paycheck to paycheck, 28% say they still plan to rely on the government and their employers’ retirement plans and simply hope that’s enough to support them through their senior years. However, less than 20% of Gen Y respondents say the same thing”(Martha C. White. “American Dream Deferred: We Now Embrace More Modest, Personal Goals.” Times, Businese & Money. Web. 1 Dec. 2011), it seems like that the “American Dream” nowadays related more about the successful, rich and money. However, everything gets two sides. The prosperity of America is created by the “American Dream”, but in someway, with the negative induce, the “American Dream” also causes big trouble. I think it as darkness of “American Dream”. With technology improves fast, the news and information spread faster, and the quality of the information can not always stay in great value, so it is easier to induce people to the bad value and cause trouble. In recent years, with the economic depression, the quality of life get down, and when people want to get a symbolic success and great life, they may be mislead in a wrong way. Then the “American Dream”, the freedom, hard working and achieve own goal, would burn the evil fire as the fuel put in the fire. The TV show “Breaking Bad” just talks about a man with misleading to darkness “American Dream”.</p>

			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>  With the economic depression started from 2008, the global economy decreases a lot. Some people lose the jobs and some people get salary decreasing. Then the money plays more important role in people daily life and the pressure becomes higher for living. For people, the basic of achieve goal or “American Dream” is money. When the economy gets down and money become more important, people need to figure out the ways to earn money, to make a live or become rich. Then, some people pursue their worth legally and some do it illegally. With the influence of the “Beat Generation,” the drug problem become bigger, and the freedom of the “American Dream” become unlimited. People do what they want and they pursued their goals personally. When the economy becomes more important in daily life, people will live for the money and see money as the core. With the economy depression and the pressure in social life the material wealth occupy a lot in our heart, and it is the product of the “American Dream” with the reality. The Mr. White is such a people fail down by “American Dream” and get mislead of negative side of “American Dream.” So I think the public should find back the original value of “American Dream”, the happiness, hard working, and right way of freedom (not unlimited), and save the “American Dream.” Then we can correct and make the revolution of the moral and the value of the society. </p>

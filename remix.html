		<p>In this project, our team chose the topic “how does the game affect our life?” At first, we reviewed the paper we wrote before this project, and the Mohamed’s second paper was considered being interesting enough for us. It was a paper which talked about how games affect the life. Thus we decided to choose this paper as the basis of this project. The issue we chose affected me composing the project by interviewing different people to see how game affects their life, because there were many friends around us play video games. Composing this project let me know how game affects our life within this developing world. I had a deeply understand of the advantages and disadvantages of the games and how do we balance the game between the hobbies and addict. After we decided to make the interview video for documentary, the two problems were existed to solve. The first one was which game was used to talk about mainly as the model in the documentary. The second one was that some interviewees were too shy to accept the interview. These problems encounter us to do the documentary for a while due to we wanted to find the famous game to discuss and had to make sure the interviewee could talk naturally. As most people play the games, I thought the audience would feel familiar with their life from the documentary. Thus, the audience played role as the judgment for how the game affects our life and they also referred to consider own life and experience related with the interviewees in the documentary. I thought the end of the documentary was an open end, and every audience could find the answer by themselves how the games affected them and were games good or bad?</p>
		<p>Selecting a topic from each team member’s paper was a difficult choice due to everyone wrote perfect and interesting paper before. We read each one’s three essay wrote before this project. Because every team member in my team are male, we were all interesting about games, then the Mohamed’s essay which talked about games was selected as the basis of documentary. For me, the most challenging part of the project for me was the interview with interviewees, because I was the interviewer in the documentary and sometimes I felt nervous front of the camera to do the interview. Thus, we made a little trick. We first shot the question at once. Then we shot answers at once with another angle and connect with questions together by iMovie. This helped me felt less nervous. Another challenging part was the subtitle of documentary. We had to listen the video and type the subtitle corresponding with the video. With the process, we designed the documentary steps by steps. Every scene was useful. Some scenes were for audiences had break within the documentary, some were for introduction, and some were for conclusion with deep thinking. I totally believed that we did a systematic approach.</p>
		<p>Within the documentary and interview, those games player shared us their story and experiences with the games. It was hard to say which resource was notably beneficial or not to all the people. Only to my opinion, the most beneficial resource was how to survive from the addict of the games, which were time manage, self restrict and life passion. On the other hand, if I had to speak out which resource was proved to be the least beneficial was the question which about “ only nerd plays video games?” It was a funny question cause everyone played games and it was a necessary part in the daily life. This question was a little bias.</p>
		<p>The teamwork was also a crucial part within the documentary making. Fortunately, my team started design the documentary early. Thus we had arranged the work well before making the documentary exactly. Thus, we had enough time to make the documentary. Every step worked as what we expected to, and we work well on every step, which was designed before. So we work fruitfully actually. I was the interviewer and Chi Zhang was the camera shooter and Mohamed work as the interviewee and the subtitle checker. The efficient collaboration helped us a lot.</p>
		<p>Overall the documentary design, making and final refinement, I think my team basically achieve the goals we want and the requirement of the class. We wanted to make a documentary with the interview. The initial design idea was that the documentary should not only give audience information but left the space to let them thinking. Thus, the documentary with the interview offered people information, example and also leave space to think and review. I think the most effective aspect of the documentary was the interview part cause it gives people information and let them thinking about it. If there are some things we could do again, I think it should be the introduction part of the documentary. It was so simple and dull. If I could do it again, I prefer to add more imagine and music within that part. But overall the all work we done, this is a great experience for me and lead me study more within the designing of the documentary. </p>
